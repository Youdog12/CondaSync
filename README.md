# CondaSync - Automatic Dependency Tracker

### Why?

Most package managers, such as npm and yarn, update your dependency files the moment you make any changes to your environment. Conda (surprisingly) does not. Existing solutions require you to manually update your dependency list, which is tedious and prone to errors.

CondaSync is a simple VSCode Extension that integrates directly into your environment and silently does the boring work for you.

### How?

CondaSync is built using TypeScript and the Chokidar package.
